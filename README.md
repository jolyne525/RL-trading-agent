## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** agent designed for automated stock trading. Built with **Streamlit** for interactivity, the agent utilizes **Q-Learning** with linear function approximation to make trading decisions (Buy, Sell, Hold) based on market state representations.

The system simulates a Markov Decision Process (MDP) on real historical data (via `yfinance`), aiming to maximize the **Sharpe Ratio** and **Total Returns** while managing transaction costs.

## Key Features

* **Interactive Training**: Visualize the Q-Learning process in real-time as the agent iterates through episodes.
* **Real-World Data**: Fetches real-time stock data (e.g., NVDA, AAPL) using the Yahoo Finance API.
* **Performance Metrics**: Automatically calculates key financial metrics for CVs:
    * **Alpha** (Excess Return vs. Benchmark)
    * **Sharpe Ratio** (Risk-adjusted Return)
    * **Cumulative Return**
* **Strategy Comparison**: Benchmarks the RL agent against a standard "Buy & Hold" strategy.
* **Interpretability**: Uses a linear approximation for Q-values to maintain transparency in decision logic.

## Methodology (MDP Formulation)

The trading problem is modeled as an MDP $(S, A, P, R)$:

* **State Space ($S$)**: A vector representing market conditions:
    $$S_t = [\text{Daily Return}, \text{Holding Status}, \text{Bias}]$$
* **Action Space ($A$)**: Discrete actions $\{0: \text{Hold}, 1: \text{Buy}, 2: \text{Sell}\}$.
* **Reward Function ($R$)**:
    $$R_t = \Delta \text{NetWorth} - \text{Transaction Cost}$$
    The agent is penalized for excessive trading to simulate realistic friction costs.
